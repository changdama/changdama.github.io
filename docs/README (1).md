# COSMIC-PULSES
"Sound Architecture Machine"-Explore the Interactive Relationship between Sound, Human Activities and Architecture

## INTRODUCTION
Architecture space always serves human beings, and the main task of architects is to design spaces that are suitable for human beings. But does the so-called “human-friendly” space designed by architects really meet people’s needs? Therefore, the adaptability of space should be determined by people’s activities in the space.

Why human beings need to move in architecture space, they need a purpose to pull them to generate motivation, so human beings and architecture need a motivation or a factor to coordinate. Music is a great factor. 1970s, the birth of avant-garde music, avant-garde music composers usually use symbolic notation to record the notes, melody, and rhythm, etc., the music creates new graphic combinations of characteristics, and graphics also form a new music, the music is also a new graphic combination of characteristics. The music created new graphic combinations and the graphics created new musical forms, an interaction that can be translated to music, architecture and human activity. Nature is boundless, it symbolizes freedom, similar to the freedom of movement in architecture space, so eco-accoustic is a kind of musical freedom of movement.

## SOUND SELECTED
### Stackhausen's piece "COSMIC PULSES" ###
*Cosmic Pulses* is the 13th "hour" of Stockhausen's originally-planned 24-part cycle KLANG ("SOUND") which is based on the 24 hours of the day. Thiselectronic work is composed of 24 layers of synthesizer-generated melodic material, with each layer having a different speed and pitch register. The layers enter one by one, starting from the lowest/slowest layer, and go up in sequence to the highest/fastest layer.

### Ecoacoustics ###
Ecoacoustics is an interdisciplinary science that investigates natural and anthropogenic sounds and their relationship with the environment over a wide range of study scales, both spatial and temporal, including populations, communities, and landscapes. Ecoacoustics operates in all types of terrestrial and aquatic (freshwater and marine) ecosystems.

## SOUND MACHINE PRINCIPLE 1 ##
### Description ###
**Players**: 24 Different Sounds, 8 from each of 3 categories- Anthro, Bio &Geophony

**Gameboard**: Wheel with 3 Concentric Rings of Different Sounds

**Rule**: 
- Play of 24 sounds in different combinations
- 8 sounds in 3 layers playing in random orders but fixed time intervals
- Time Interval between each sounds is according to the Fibonacci Series

**Result**: The result is a creation of a unique sound machine in each combination

- **Improvisation**
  
  Another max patch is added to randomly change the thresholds of the low shelf gain, mid gain, and high shelf gain of each group of voices to enrich the "sound machine" effect by improvising the control of the three low shelf gain, mid gain, and high shelf 
  buttons on the spot to randomize the thresholds of the voices.

- **Sound-optimized design**

     Each category has a bass part, an arpeggiator, and a synth playing backup chords。Each sound machine contains one of them. The selection of instruments will be as complementary as possible to the samples. For example, bird samples with higher pitches and denser 
   sounds will be paired with bass parts with lower pitches and longer notes. In contrast, the samples of summer night insects are paired with an arpeggiator, which can light up the whole section. All the notes or chords only change when the sound machine switches to a
   new sample.
  
   ![Image 8](Fig/8.png)

     Besides, instrumental parts from each category use different scales. However, to ensure natural transition when approaching sound machines from a different category, and a harmonious overall effect, the scales are closely related to each other: g natural minor 
   for Biophony, F major for Anthrophony, bB major for Geophony. This consideration mainly roots from our vision of harmonious coexistence between human and nature.

## SOUND MACHINE PRINCIPLE 2 ##
### Description  ###
**Players**: 8 different sound machines.

**Gameboard**: Box with a medium divided into 24 layers.

**Rules**: 
- Play of 8 different sound machines in different combinations & positions.
- Movement in positive & negative X direction.
- Movement in positive & negative Y direction.

**Result**: The result is a creation of a interactive soundscape relative to position.

### Effect of One Sound Machine in Medium
For the effects in the medium, The sound generates spatial lines in the medium of unity, and as the sound travels through the medium, the sparsity of the spatial lines changes，which like sound creates ripples in the water.

### SOUNDSCAPE: SOUND MACHINES IN MEDIUM ###

### Section of Sound Machines in Soundscape  ###

**Sound Waves of Different Sound Machines**:

**Sound Machines Movement**:

Dissecting the medium into 24 layers and exploring the iterations of different movements and across different time periods.

![Image 12](Fig/12.jpg)

The wave forms of Sound Machines are analysed at different time periods to visualise the frequency and displacement. They are then subjected to a box with a medium and targeted with a point source of sound in different positions. The final diagrams are the visualisations of these sound machines interacting with the medium and each other.(Take "SAME TIME PERIOD POSITIONS: TOP 4 MACHINES IN –X DIRECTION, BOTTOM 4 MACHINES IN +X DIRECTION" as an example)

## SOUND MACHINES, PEOPLE AND SPACE INTERACTION ##

### Description of each interactive factors ###

The interactive envionmenet is built in Unity, envisioning it as a medium. Sound, people and medium are interacted with each other. Based on two principles, We put eight "sound machines"，they make rotating sounds through their respective black sound speakers.

### Interaction With Person ###

For interaction with people, as the person gets closer to the speaker, the sound gets progressively louder and the spatial lines produced in the medium get denser; the further the person gets away from the speaker, the sound gets progressively smaller and the spatial lines produced in the medium get sparse.
